Subject: [PlanetsCentral] Turn file rejected

Hi,

your turn file was REJECTED.
I could not match it to any active game you play.

Probably you have subscribed to the game using a different email
address then for submitting this turn. Please resubmit the file
with the correct sender address, or use the web interface at
<https://planetscentral.com/login.cgi?returnto=host/>.
