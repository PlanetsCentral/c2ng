    /** Compound score.
        This class provides a front end to query a TurnScoreList or TurnScore object.
        In particular, it allows building compound scores, such as "Total Ships" being the sum of ScoreId_Freighters and ScoreId_Capital,
        and it allows querying scores for player sets (i.e. teams).

        As a general rule, a compound score query produces a valid result if all columns (Score Ids) are present in the TurnScoreList schema,
        and at least some of them have a known value.
        That is, "Total Ships" can be computed if the score file has the ScoreId_Freighters and ScoreId_Capital columns,
        even if the ScoreId_Capital for a particular player is not known,
        or if the score for a team is being computed and one team member's scores are not known.

        CompoundScore has a maximum limit of components and goes into an invalid state when that limit is exceeded.
        In invalid state, it answers all queries with "unknown".
        As of 20170409, that component limit is 4.

        Since scores are physically indexed by slot numbers, and a TurnScoreList manages the mapping from score Ids to slot numbers,
        the TurnScoreList object used with calls to a CompoundScore instance must always be the same. */
