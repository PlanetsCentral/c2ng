Notes
------

  This code is intended to enhance the VGA Planets game, not to harm it.
  PCC2 respects the shareware limitations of the game. It is not meant
  in any way meant to circumvent or "crack" the registration system.
  The authors of PCC2 do not accept or endorse modifications which
  break the registration system.


Other Licenses that apply to parts of PCC2
-------------------------------------------

  The SDL and SDL_image libraries are licensed under the GNU LGPL. In
  a nutshell, this means that you must dynamically link against them.

  The Windows installer uses the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System
  (NSIS).

  Some of the fonts are based upon the Lucida Bright bitmap fonts,
  copyright Bigelow & Holmes 1986, 1985, taken from an older DJGPP
  distribution, which in turn got them from X10. They have been
  heavily edited to support the WGL4 character repertoire, plus some
  additions, totaling to about 900 characters each now.
