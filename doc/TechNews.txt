PCC2ng NEWS FILE - Technical Version
====================================

  This file contains changes relevant for people building things with
  PCC2ng. User-related changes are in NEWS.txt. Script-related changes
  (e.g. new properties or commands) can be found in the scripting
  manual.


2.40.9
------

### c2play-server: STORAGE.LAUNCHERS

  STORAGE.LAUNCHERS was reporting incorrect value (off-by-one
  indexes); this has been fixed to match the CCScript
  STORAGE.LAUNCHERS property.


### all servers, c2console: command line

  The `-D` command-line option to override a configuration option now
  works as it should. Some programs (prominently, c2console) were
  requiring `--D` instead. This has been fixed, the correct syntax is
  `-DKEY=VALUE`.

  As a side effect, the options `nocron` (host) and `notx` (mailout)
  options now need to be written with two dashes (`--nocron`); they
  have always been documented this way, but were previously accepted
  with a single dash as well.


### all programs: source code

  The `main()` functions are now all under `main/`.

  The game proxies have been moved from `client/` to `game/` and no
  longer have hard dependencies to UI code. They can therefore now (in
  theory) be used to build a UI using a different toolkit.



2.40.8
------

### c2play-server: messages

  A bug preventing access to the last message has been fixed.
