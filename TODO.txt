Major Concept Verification
==========================

MULTITHREADED SIMULATOR.
- [DONE] Make a stripped-down copy of ShipList to copy around.
  . implemented for VCR algorithms, but not yet needed
- [DONE] Make a simulator-runner with multiple threads.

PLANETSCENTRAL API. The existing API commands mostly map to microservice commands.
We need coarser granularity.
- file/lsgame or file/stat should provide enough information to build a Folder.
- file/ls should produce file hashes to allow client-side caching.
- REST API?


Minor Concept Verification
==========================

UNDO. The dat/dis style is cumbersome and does not map cleanly to Nu or Host data.
- [DONE] Make a Reverter interface with implementations for v3/Nu/Host.

MAKETURN/SAVE.
- [DONE]

ABILITIES/ADVANTAGES.
- Map Nu advantages to racial abilities or configuration.

LOCAL/NETWORK WORKSPLIT.
- [DONE] Set up complete game directories for network v3 games.
- Cache Nu history results locally.

SERVERS.
- [DONE] Implement more PlanetsCentral servers within the new infrastructure.
- Implement integrated router/server.

MESSAGES. Can we integrate all messages (in-game messages, PMs, activities, forum, VCR, files) into one interface?
- Make an interface that provides heading/text/parsed data/VCR.
- Cannot load everything locally, only in-game messages.
- .rss parser for update notifications?

FILER NG.
- [DONE] Use SHA-1 addressing (like git) for implicit deduplication.
- Add transaction support: upload many files at once and commit at the end; fork dataspace for backup.
- Add support for symlinks so that user:u/user/path/player9.rst can actually be a link to host:games/0001/out/9/player9.rst.
  . [DONE] alternative: store user and host data in same filer, so we get internal deduplication
- [DONE] Requires export/import for host runs!
- fsck/garbage collection

SDL2/ANDROID.
- [DONE] Basic port done.
- Touch events!


Features
========

HOST PREDICTION. We can do history, doing prediction should be possible.

SPECIFICATION BROWSER. A better version of CCShips.
- [DONE] Browse hulls, engines, beams, torpedoes, abilities.
- [DONE] Determine abilities such as "2x mining" from config.
- [DONE] Allow searching for "who can build heaters" or "what are my cloak ships"

MORE HOSTS. Can we do CircusMaximus?

OBJECT FILE (*.qc) SUPPORT.

PCC1 FEATURES MISSING IN PCC2.
- data transmissions (VPA, Informer)
- data transmission settings
- [DONE] turn checker
- [DONE] *.ccb management (ccbmerge)
- history management


MISC
=====

INTERPRETER REWORKS.
- Constant folding. Translate '"foo" & chr(33)' into a string.
- Rework expressions to reference+deleter style instead of current auto_ptr style.

SUPPORT 8-BPP.
- Need to disable or tweak graphical effects. It's easy to saturate the GUI thread by just scrolling around
  on the main screen.
- Do we still need this?

HISTORY.
- When loading history ships, clear the mission settings. Don't say the last mission of a stolen ship forever.


CLEANUP
========

- client::widgets::BusyIndicator -> ui::widgets
- client::dialogs::DirectorySelectionDialog -> ui::dialogs
- too much code is using _() for translation
