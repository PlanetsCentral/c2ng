     \brief FLAK Playback

     This namespace contains functions to play FLAK.

     FLAK is easier to play back fluently than classic VCR because the engine already handles torpedo flight time.
     For FLAK playback, we therefore just receive the event stream from FLAK, and display it.

     Entry points:
     - PlaybackScreen
     - Renderer
